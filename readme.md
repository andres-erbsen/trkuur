See the examples directory for usage and [my own paper](https://github.com/andres-erbsen/PriorityMail/blob/master/paper/mlmail.tex) for a more sophisticated example.

Tested with MiKTeX 2.9 and the TexWorks editor - use the XeLaTeX + bib builder.

Should work with TexLive medium install (without sources/docs) and the
following additional packages: etoolbox tocloft enumitem chngcntr sectsty titlesec makecmds polyglossia hyphen-estonian makecmds polyglossia biblatex logreq xstring todonotes
